========================  GGRB spectral model  ========================

This package contains the GGRB spectral model suitable to be used in XSPEC
(see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/XSappendixLocal.html)


This model has been used to perform the gamma-ray burst spectral
analysis on Fermi/GBM data discussed in MNRAS, 448, 403C, 2015:

"There is a short gamma-ray burst prompt phase at the beginning of
each long one"

*** INTRODUCTION

The GGRB can be used as a spectral model to fit Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) spectra.  It is designed to replace both the cutoff power law
(CUTOFFPL) and the Band (GRBM, Band et al., 1993, ApJ, 413, 281)
spectral models.

The main advantages of the GGRB model are:

 - it uses an integrated flux (in an energy band defined by the user)
   as a free parameter in the fit, while both the CUTOFFPL and GRBM
   models use a model normalization at a given energy.  This is very
   useful when we are interested in the integrated flux in a given
   band, since we do not have to propagate the parameter uncertainties
   through the parameter covariance matrix.  A possible alternative
   would be to use the CFLUX convolution model (already available in
   XSPEC), although it requires the integration energy range to lie
   within the band defined in the detector response matrix.  GGRB
   provides a greatest flexibility since it relaxes this requirement;

 - both the peak energy and the integrated flux are parametrized ith
   logarithmic quantities (log_Ep and log_Flux).  This results in
   simpler and more symmetric parameter uncertainties, with respect to
   their linear counterparts (see Cabrera et al., 2007, MNRAS, 382,
   342);



*** MODEL PARAMETERS

The GGRB model has eight parameters:

1 - alpha:    the photon spectral index for energies smaller than the
              peak energy;

2 - beta:     the photon spectral index for energies greater than the
              peak energy; (only for the Band model);

3 - log_Ep:   the logarithm of the energy of the spectrum peak in the
              nuFnu representation [keV];

4 - log_Flux: the logarithm of the integrated flux (in units of erg
              s^-1 cm^-2) in the energy band defined by Emin and Emax;

5 - Emin:     lower limit of the integration energy band [keV];

6 - Emax:     higher limit of the integration energy band [keV];

7 - opt:      option setting to select the spectral model:
              - 0: cutoff power law
              - 1: Band model

8 - norm:     overall model normalization



*** USAGE

The GGRB model is an XSPEC additive model designed to replace the
CUTOFFPL and GRBM spectral models in GRB spectral fitting.  The opt
parameter is used to select the appropriate spectral model: either the
cutoff power law (opt=0) or the Band model (opt=1).  The opt
parameter must be freezed for fitting.

The alpha parameter is either the photon spectral index of the
cutoff powerlaw or the low-energy photon spectral index of the Band
model.

The beta parameter is the high-energy photon spectral index of the
Band model.  When the cutoff power law model is selected (opt=0) the
beta parameter must be freezed for fitting.

The log_Ep parameter is the logarithm (base 10) of the energy of the
spectrum peak in the nuFnu representation.  Note however that the
spectrum will have a peak only if alpha>-2 and alpha>beta.

The log_Flux parameter is the logarithm (base 10) of the integrated
flux in the energy band defined by Emin and Emax.  The Emin and Emax
parameters must be freezed for fitting.

The norm parameter must be set to 1 and freezed during fitting, since
the model normalization is provided by the log_Flux parameter.

An example of the usage of the GGRB model is given in the
test_ggrb.xcm file.



*** INSTALL

In order to install the model to a local directory (say
~/xspec_models) on a UNIX-like platform run these commands:

rm -rf   ~/xspec_models/ggrb
mkdir -p ~/xspec_models/ggrb
cp ggrb.dat ggrb.cxx ~/xspec_models/ggrb
echo "initpackage pkg_ggrb ggrb.dat $HOME/xspec_models/ggrb" | xspec


To automatically load the GGRB package each time you start XSPEC add
the following line to your XSPEC configuration file (typically
~/.xspec/xspec.rc)

lmod pkg_ggrb $HOME/xspec_models/ggrb
